Mastering JOIN statements is one of the most important parts of SQL, as combining data from multiple database tables is a core skill for data analysts. And when you apply for jobs,
remember that JOIN statements are a common topic in data analyst interviews! The more JOIN statements you write, the more prepared you will be for a data analyst role.
Consider this scenario which will help you to clarify the concept of INNER JOIN & LEFT JOIN: 

You have been provided a data for a feature sports article on Michael Jordan’s basketball career. 
The writer wants to include a funny twist and asks you to find out if Michael Jordan played better at schools with animal mascots.

To analyze his early career, you start with the years he played basketball in college. 
You need to examine National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) college basketball stats from 1984.

You’ll need a list of all NCAA Division I colleges and universities; their mascots, if applicable; and their number of wins and losses. 
"You can find this information in the public dataset ncaa_basketball on BigQuery."

Next, you will write a query. 
Your query should join the season statistics from one table with the mascot information from another. 
You need to use a LEFT JOIN here, instead of an INNER JOIN because not all teams have mascots. If you use an INNER JOIN, you would exclude teams with no mascot.

SELECT
 seasons.market AS university,
 seasons.name AS team_name,
 seasons.wins,
 seasons.losses,
 seasons.ties,
 mascots.mascot AS team_mascot
FROM
 `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons` AS seasons
LEFT JOIN
 `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mascots` AS mascots
ON
 seasons.team_id = mascots.id
WHERE
 seasons.season = 1984
 AND seasons.division = 1
ORDER BY
 seasons.market
